#### Overview

##### Solve a Sudoku with AI

The project consisted in implementing two extensions of an exisisintg sudoku solver. The first is the technique called "naked twins". The second one allows for solving a diagonal sudoku.

##### Build a Game-Playing Agent

In this project, an adversarial search agent to play the game "Isolation" is developed. Isolation is a deterministic, two-player game of perfect information in which the players alternate turns moving a single piece from one cell to another on a board. Whenever either player occupies a cell, that cell becomes blocked for the remainder of the game. The first player with no remaining legal moves loses, and the opponent is declared the winner. These rules are implemented in the isolation.

##### Implement a Planning Search

In this project, a group of problems in classical PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) is defined for the air cargo domain discussed in the lectures. Then, we set up the problems for search, experiment with various automatically generated heuristics, including planning graph heuristics, to solve the problems, and then provide an analysis of the results. Additionally, a short research review paper is written on the historical development of planning techniques and their use in artificial intelligence.

##### Build a Sign Language Recognizer

This project consists in building a system that can recognize words communicated using the American Sign Language (ASL).  A preprocessed dataset of tracked hand and nose positions extracted from video is provided. The goal is to train a set of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) using part of this dataset to try and identify individual words from test sequences.
